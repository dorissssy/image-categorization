# image-categorization

This model uses neural networks to identify and classify images in four languages in the data set, Chinese, English, Russian, and Danish, and can identify complex images in the data set in a relatively accurate manner. This model applies image processing in Tensorflow, Sequential model, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, AveragePooling2D, Dropout, Flatten, Dense, Activation, BatchNormalization and some packages in sklearn to train the data in the training set. After repeated trials and adjustments of various parameters, the prediction accuracy rate of the testing set finally reached 93%.

此模型运用神经网络，用于识别与归类数据集中存在的四种语言的图像，中文，英文，俄文，与丹麦文，能够较为准确的识别数据集中复杂的图像。此模型应用Tensorflow中的图像处理，Sequential model, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, AveragePooling2D, Dropout,Flatten,Dense,Activation, BatchNormalization与sklearn中的一些包来训练training set中的数据。经过反复试验与调节各项参数，最终使得testing set的预测准确率达到93%。
